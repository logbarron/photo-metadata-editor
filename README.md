When you photograph or scan prints and negatives, the date and location information is often incorrect. This tool updates the metadata to reflect when and where the photos were actually taken. Once corrected, photos can be transferred between Macs with an optional automated Apple Photos import.

## Features

- **Date and Location Detection** - Suggests date and location from filename using a finetuned LLM
  - Example: `Family_Reunion_Chicago_IL_July_4_1995_0351.heic` → Chicago, IL + July 4, 1995
- **Location Search** - Add location metadata using Apple Maps integration (cities, landmarks, addresses)
- **Search and Grid View** - Browse and select multiple photos with 50-per-page pagination
- **Mac-to-Mac Pipeline** - Transfer edited photos between Macs with automatic import to Apple Photos (optional)
