Analyze this photo filename to determine WHERE the photo was taken.

For each filename, think step by step:
1. What is likely the SUBJECT of the photo? (what's in it)
2. Is there a LOCATION NAME explicitly written in the filename?
3. Are there any clues about the type of location? (restaurant, park, home, tourist spot, etc.)
4. Is this a place you could find on a public map, or is it someone's personal property?

Output JSON with these fields:
{
  "location_confidence": "high/medium/low/none",
  "primary_search": "<best search query for Apple Maps>",
  "alternate_search": "<backup search if primary is wrong>",
  "location_type": "venue/landmark/city/address/unknown",
  "location_context": "<explanation of your reasoning>",
  
  "extracted": {
    "subject": "<what the photo is OF>",
    "where_taken": "<where you think it was taken>",
    "landmark_name": "<specific place name if mentioned>",
    "city": "<city if found - keep abbreviations like NYC, SF, LA as-is>",
    "state": "<2-letter code if US/Canada>",
    "country": "<country if not US>",
    "date_parts": {"year": null, "month": null, "day": null}
  },
  
  "search_strategy": "venue_first/city_first/landmark_only/need_more_info"
}

Rules:
- Set location_confidence="none" if location is: home, house, grandma's, grandpa's, or any personal/family place
- For search queries, remove activity/event words: "Beach Vacation Cancun" → "Cancun"
- Keep common city abbreviations unchanged: NYC stays NYC, SF stays SF, LA stays LA
- Month names: Jan→"01", Feb→"02", Mar→"03", Apr→"04", May→"05", Jun→"06", Jul→"07", Aug→"08", Sep→"09", Oct→"10", Nov→"11", Dec→"12"
- Extract ISO dates like 2023-05-15 as year:"2023", month:"05", day:"15"
- Extract partial dates like 2023-05 as year:"2023", month:"05", day:null
- For dates like "July 4th 2023", extract as year:"2023", month:"07", day:"04"
- Trailing 3-4 digits are sequence numbers unless part of a year
- Filename can have any extension (.heic, .jpg, .png, etc.)
- CRITICAL: Always add a comma after "date_parts": {...} since more fields follow it
